# Lobox Frontend Assignment

This is my solution for the Lobox Frontend Developer technical assignment.

## ðŸ“Œ Tech Stack:
- ReactJS
- TypeScript
- Shadcn/UI (based on Radix UI and Tailwind CSS)

## ðŸ“Œ Why Shadcn/UI?
I decided to use **Shadcn/UI** because it provides clean, accessible, and reusable components out of the box, helping me build the multi-select dropdown quickly and efficiently within the given timeframe.  
It also allowed me to focus on logic and interaction behavior rather than starting from scratch with UI elements.

## ðŸ“Œ Features:
- Multi-select dropdown
- Ability to add new items by typing and pressing Enter
- Close the dropdown by clicking outside
- Simple and clean design

## ðŸ“Œ Improvements for the future:
- Replace Shadcn styles with pure SCSS as required in the assignment
- Add the ability to remove items from the selected list
- Improve keyboard navigation and accessibility
- Add open/close animations
- Custom color themes and design refinements

This is an MVP version and can be enhanced further.
